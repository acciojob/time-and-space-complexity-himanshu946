    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time Complexity measures the computational time an algorithm 
    takes based on input size. It helps evaluate efficiency, predict performance, 
    and compare algorithms. Expressed using Big O notation (e.g., 
it describes runtime growth as inputs increase. Common complexities include:</p>

<p><b>Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by
an algorithm/program,
including the space of input values for execution.</b></p>
