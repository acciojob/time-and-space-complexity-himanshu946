    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity in Computer Science</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a concept that describes how efficient a program is. It measures the time it takes for a program to run as a function of the size of the input.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another important concept. It measures the amount of memory a program uses in relation to the size of the input. A program with a space complexity of O(n) uses a linear amount of memory.</p>
